## 1. Introduction to LLM as Judge

### What is LLM as Judge?
- An automated evaluation system using LLMs to assess:
  - Answer quality
  - Question quality
  - Content relevance
  - Response completeness

### Why Do We Need It?
- Scalable evaluation solution
- Consistent scoring criteria
- Reduced human bias
- Real-time feedback capability

## 2. Key Evaluation Metrics

### 2.1 Agreement Score
- **What**: Measures exact matches between LLM and human evaluation
- **Range**: 0 to 1
  - 0: No agreement
  - 1: Perfect agreement
- **Example**: Agreement Score of 0.314 in question evaluation indicates moderate alignment

### 2.2 Spearman's Rank Correlation
- **What**: Measures ranking consistency
- **Range**: -1 to 1
  - -1: Perfect negative correlation
  - 0: No correlation
  - 1: Perfect positive correlation
- **Example**: Correlation of 0.457 in stand-alone quality shows moderate positive correlation

### 2.3 Cohen's Kappa
- **What**: Inter-rater reliability metric
- **Range**: -1 to 1
  - < 0: Poor agreement
  - 0.01-0.20: Slight agreement
  - 0.21-0.40: Fair agreement
  - 0.41-0.60: Moderate agreement
  - 0.61-0.80: Substantial agreement
  - 0.81-1.00: Almost perfect agreement

## 3. Bias Analysis

### 3.1 Position Bias
- **What**: Impact of question/answer position on scores
- **Range**: -1 to 1
  - Closer to 0: Less position bias
- **Real Example**: 
  - LLM Position Bias: -0.043
  - Human Position Bias: 0.014

### 3.2 Length Bias
- **What**: Impact of response length on scores
- **Range**: -1 to 1
  - Positive: Favors longer responses
  - Negative: Favors shorter responses
- **Real Example**:
  - LLM Length Bias: 0.096
  - Human Length Bias: -0.271

---

## 4. Robustness Testing

### Robustness Score
- **What**: Stability of evaluation under minor modifications
- **Formula**: 1 - (Perturbed Variance / Original Variance)
- **Range**: 0 to 1
  - Higher score: More stable evaluation
  - Lower score: Less stable evaluation

---

## 5. Real-world Examples

### Answer Evaluation Example
- **Stand-alone Quality**:
  - Mean LLM Score: 3.08
  - Mean Human Score: 3.10
  - MAE: 0.7025

### Question Evaluation Example
- **Overall Scores**:
  - LLM Mean: 0.727
  - Human Mean: 0.715
  - Agreement Score: 0.314

## 6. Implementation Insights

### Key Components
1. Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_agreement(llm_scores, human_scores, threshold=0.1):
    return np.mean(np.abs(llm_scores - human_scores) <= threshold)
```

### Best Practices
1. Use threshold-based agreement
2. Implement bias checks
3. Regular calibration with human evaluators
4. Comprehensive metric suite
